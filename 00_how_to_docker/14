#14. Launch a wordpress container as a background task, just for fun. The container
#should be named lair, its 80 port should be bound to the 8080 port of the virtual
#machine, and it should be able to use the spawning-pool container as a database
#service. You can try to access lair on your machine via a web browser, with the
#IP address of the virtual machine as a URL.
#Congratulations, you just deployed a functional Wordpress website in two commands!

docker run -p 8080:80 --name lair -d --link spawning-pool:mysql wordpress
