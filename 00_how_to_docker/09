#9. From the shell of a debian container, install via the containerâ€™s package manager
#everything you need to compile C source code and push it onto a git repo (of
#course, make sure before that the package manager and the packages already in the
#container are updated). For this exercise, you should only specify the commands
#to be run directly in the container.

docker run -it debian

#Via debian shell

#apt update
#apt install -y gcc
#apt install -y git
