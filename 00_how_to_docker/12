#12. Launch a mysql container as a background task. It should be able to restart on its
#own in case of error, and the root password of the database should be Kerrigan.
#You will also make sure that the database is stored in the hatchery volume, that
#the container directly creates a database named zerglings, and that the container
#itself is named spawning-pool.

docker run --name spawning-pool --restart on-failure -v hatchery:/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=Kerrigan -e MYSQL_DATABASE=zerglings -d mysql:5.6
