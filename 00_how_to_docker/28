#28. Damn it, a group of zergs is attacking orbital-command, and shutting down
#the engineering-bay service wonâ€™t help at all... You must send a troup of Marines
#to eliminate the intruders. Launch a 42school/marine-squad in two replicas,
#and make sure that the service works properly (see the documentation provided
#at hub.docker.com). This service will be named... marines and will be on the
#overmind network.

docker service create -d --name marines --network overmind --replicas 2 -e OC_USERNAME=lrorscha -e OC_PASSWD=qwerty 42school/marine-squad
